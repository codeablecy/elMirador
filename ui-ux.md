PAGE SECTIONS (One-Page Scroll Layout)
1. HERO SECTION (PRIMER NIVEL - Above the Fold)

2. GALLERY SECTION (SEGUNDO NIVEL)
Background: Light Gray/Off-White (#e9e4e3) for contrast with previous/next sections if they use different backgrounds.
Layout:
Section Title: Centered, bold text: "Explore Our Spaces" or "Galería de El Mirador" (Secondary Dark Blue/Teal).
Content:
Images: Wix Pro Gallery (or equivalent).
UI/UX: Configured as a responsive grid or carousel. Thumbnails open into a lightbox view for larger images. High-quality, professional photography is crucial.
Videos: Embedded video player (e.g., YouTube/Vimeo).
UI/UX: Prominent video thumbnail that expands to play in a lightbox or inline. Short, engaging property tours.
Construction Progress (Avance de Obras):
UI/UX: Could be a separate small gallery within this section or a dedicated sub-section. Each image should have a date stamp (e.g., "Progress: June 2025"). Clearly shows ongoing development, building trust.
3. THE PROMOTION / LOCATION (TERCER NIVEL)
Background: Secondary Dark Blue/Teal (#234457) or a lighter shade if contrast is needed with text.
Layout: Split section (e.g., 60/40 or 50/50).
Left Side (or Top on Mobile): Large, compelling image of the property's unique selling point (e.g., architectural render, aerial view, green spaces).

Section Title: Centered: "Typologies & Prices" (Secondary Dark Blue/Teal).

Image: Small thumbnail of the typology's interior or floor plan.
Details:
Superficie: (e.g., "120 m²") - Secondary Dark Blue/Teal.

UI/UX: Background: Primary Orange (#f39416), Text: White. Clicking opens a lightbox with the full floor plan image/PDF.
UI/UX Option 2 (If many types): A responsive table with sortable columns (though Wix's native table features might be limited, so might require custom code or design workarounds).

Background: Secondary Dark Blue/Teal (#234457).
Layout:
Section Title: Centered: "Quality Specifications" or "Memoria de Calidades" (White text).
Content: Wix Accordion FAQ element is ideal here.
UI/UX: Each accordion header (e.g., "Kitchen Features", "Bathroom Finishes", "Energy Efficiency", "Smart Home Integration") uses the Primary Orange (#f39416) or secondary dark blue/teal for text, with a clear icon (e.g., plus/minus) to indicate expand/collapse.
Expanded Content: Detailed bullet points or short paragraphs describing the materials, brands, and features. (White text on secondary background).
UI/UX: Allows users to quickly scan and dive into details they care about without overwhelming the page.
6. LOCATION MAP (SEXTO NIVEL)
Background: Light Gray/Off-White (#e9e4e3).
Layout:
Section Title: Centered: "Our Location" or "Mapa de Localización" (Secondary Dark Blue/Teal).
Content:
Google Maps Embed: Large, interactive Google Map widget centered on the property's exact location.
UI/UX: Ensure it's responsive and allows zoom/pan. A clear marker for "El Mirador".
Address: Below the map, clearly display the full address (Secondary Dark Blue/Teal).
Directions Button (Optional but Recommended): Button: "Get Directions".
UI/UX: Primary Orange (#f39416) background, White text. Links directly to Google Maps directions from the user's current location.
Nearby Amenities (Optional): A small list or icons for proximity to key amenities (schools, parks, transport, shopping).
UI/UX: Provides additional value and context for the location.

UI/UX CONSIDERATIONS ACROSS THE SITE:
Consistency: Maintain consistent button styles, typography, spacing, and color usage throughout the site.
Mobile-First Design: While designing on Wix, constantly check the mobile view. Ensure all elements are legible and interactive on smaller screens. Menus should collapse into a hamburger icon on mobile.
Readability: Use good contrast between text and background colors. Avoid large blocks of dense text; break it up with headings, subheadings, bullet points, and images.
Imagery: Use high-quality, professional, and consistent photography/renders across all sections. This is critical for a property website.
Micro-interactions: Subtle hover effects on buttons and links, smooth scrolling between sections (Wix anchors), and crisp image loading can enhance the user experience.
Loading Speed: Optimize images for web (compress them) and limit excessive animations or heavy scripts to ensure fast loading times, which is important for user retention and SEO.
Call-to-Action Placement: As per the Excel, ensure CTAs (CITA, VISITA) are easily accessible on all levels. This means keeping the header sticky and potentially adding contextual CTA buttons within relevant sections (e.g., after pricing, "Ready to See More?").
Forms: When the CITA/VISITA buttons are clicked, they should ideally open a simple, user-friendly Wix Contact Form in a lightbox or direct the user to a dedicated booking section. The form should be concise (Name, Email, Phone, Preferred Date/Time/Type of Inquiry).
Accessibility: Consider good practices like alt text for images, sufficient color contrast, and keyboard navigation.
This detailed description should provide a solid foundation for your wireframing and subsequent build on Wix. Good luck!


///nav items directions:
You're asking a great question for planning the user experience!
Based on the Excel document's structure and common website practices, here's where each of those navigation items would typically direct the user:
PROYECTOS (Projects):
This would most logically direct to the "CUARTO NIVEL - PRECIOS" (Fourth Level - Prices) section.
Why? "Proyectos" implies showcasing what's available, and the "Precios" section contains the detailed "Tipología" (Typology), "Superficie" (Surface Area), "Precio" (Price), and "Plano" (Floor Plan) which directly relate to the specific project offerings. It's the most direct way to show what the project entails.
Alternatively, or additionally, if "PROYECTOS" were a more general menu item on a multi-project site, it might link to a page listing all projects. But for a single-project site like 'El Mirador' where it's deeply integrated into one page, the pricing/typology section is the best fit.
ACTUALIDAD (News/Current Affairs):
This would direct to the "SEGUNDO NIVEL - GALERIA" (Second Level - Gallery) section, specifically focusing on the "AVANCE DE OBRAS" (Construction Progress) part.
Why? "Actualidad" often refers to updates or news. For a property development, construction progress is the most relevant and tangible "news." While "Galería" also has images and videos, the "Avance de Obras" is the direct current update.
If there were a dedicated blog for project news beyond construction, it could link there, but based on the provided structure, the gallery with progress updates is the best match.
SOMOS (About Us):
This would direct to the "TERCER NIVEL - LA PROMOCION" (Third Level - The Promotion) section, which includes "IMAGEN Y TEXTO DESCRIPTIVO UBICACIÓN PROMOCION" (Image and descriptive text about the promotion's location).
Why? "Somos" refers to who "we" are or what the project is about. The "La Promoción" section describes the essence of the development, its vision, and its unique selling points, which is essentially the "about" story of the project itself.
CONTACTO (Contact):
This would logically direct to the "SEXTO NIVEL - MAPA LOCALIZACION Y BUSCADOR DE GOOGLE MAP" (Sixth Level - Location Map and Google Map Search) section.
Why? This section provides the physical location, which is a key contact point, and it's also a good place to embed a contact form if not using a separate popup. Even if you have the phone/email in the header, having a dedicated "Contact" section with the map and potentially a brief form or instructions reinforces how to get in touch.
In summary, for your Wix Anchor Links:
PROYECTOS → Anchor to CUARTO NIVEL (Precios)
ACTUALIDAD → Anchor to SEGUNDO NIVEL (Galería, specifically near Avance de Obras if possible)
SOMOS → Anchor to TERCER NIVEL (La Promoción)
CONTACTO → Anchor to SEXTO NIVEL (Mapa Localización)
This mapping provides a clear and logical flow for users navigating your one-page site.
